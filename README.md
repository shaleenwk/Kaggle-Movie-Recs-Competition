# Kaggle-Movie-Recs-Competition
Movie recommender system built for a Kaggle competition — Top 10% finish.
This project is a movie recommender system developed as part of a Kaggle competition. The goal was to predict and recommend movies that users are most likely to enjoy based on historical rating data.
The solution combines collaborative filtering, which leverages user-user and item-item interactions, with content-based filtering, which uses movie attributes such as genre and metadata to generate recommendations. Blending both approaches helped improve recommendation quality and robustness.
